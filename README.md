# Number-Crush
## Introduction
“Number Crash” is a single-player puzzle game, which is a simplified version of the well-known game “Candy Crush”; In our “Number Crush” game, a player may iteratively swap adjacent numbers in a game board to match rows and columns of same numbers. Once the numbers match, they are eliminated from the board and are replaced with new ones, which could potentially create further matches and eliminations. A player’s goal is to collect the maximum possible score after 100 number swaps.

In this course project, you need to submit
1) [basic program] a C program to provide interactive gameplay for a human player; and
2) [AI player] a C function to generate swap decisions. We will test the performance of your AI player and compare its performance with the AI players of your classmates.
